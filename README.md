[for the curiouser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mollyacarroll/)

I'm a software developer + consultant at [Thoughtworks](https://github.com/thoughtworks). My range of professional experience includes full stack software engineering (more backend than frontend overall) + architecture/design, DevOps/CI/CD, cloud computing and more.

If I'm not helping my company with our AI growth via live training/session facilitation for all things genAI, demo development and/or in a technical SME scope for demand, I'm working on my own AI project(s) after work. And on the weekends. And at least sometimes when I do work on Thoughtworks AI. I think I know what my life's work is.
