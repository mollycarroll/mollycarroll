### AI _whatever you need_: technical leadership, innovation & full cycle/stack solution design

Currently I'm inquiring among my network to begin searching for my next role/company, having recently been affected by one of those lovely reorg/reduction/mass layoffs for which so many of us remain at risk.
However, I mainly want to learn about opportunities for exciting + challenging work in general that y'all out there may do or know of at your organizations. My AI experience + capabilities would likely be the most valuable to the right company holding a similar vision on the innovation potential and future.

[let's connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mollyacarroll/) before I publicly deploy my secret AI app that will conveniently offload some overhead work of finding a new job... and an AI portfolio project could make it easier on engineering leaders vs. "hire me because I CAN do AI". No, don't hire me till you yourself can interact with the software I built. :)

Previously I worked as a software developer + consultant at [Thoughtworks](https://github.com/thoughtworks) for about 3 years. My range of professional experience includes full stack software engineering (more backend than frontend overall) + architecture/design, DevOps/CI/CD, cloud computing and more, and I've been programming for many years before starting at Thoughtworks.
